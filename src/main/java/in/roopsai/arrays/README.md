|------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Concatenation of Array      | [LeetCode 1929](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/) | Create a result array, and copy elements from original into result two times in a single pass loop |
| 2    | Valid Anagram               | [LeetCode 242](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)           | Create a frequency array, For one string keep incrementing the frequency, for the other keep decrementing, if the resultant frequency is zero, then both strings are anagrams |
| 3    | Contains Duplicate          | [LeetCode 217](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)      | Create a HashSet of seenNumbers, if a number is seen it means a duplicate, else simply add the number to the set. At the completion of loop return false |
| 4    | Two Sum                     | [LeetCode 1](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)                   | Create a map. In the single pass loop, initially calculate the complement and if the map contains the complement then return two indices of the pair. If not exists, then add the entry (key=number, value=index of the number in array) to the map |
| 5    | Remove Element              | [LeetCode 27](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)           | Use Two Pointer Approach (i at the start of the array, j at the end of the array). If the nums[i] != val keep incrementing i, else check if nums[j] == val if so decrement j, else simply swap nums[i], nums[j]. do this until both i, j cross each other. |
